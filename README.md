## ✨ Stellara Premise

Stellara is a living simulation of consequence—civilizations formed from philosophical seeds, growing in dynamic harmony or dissonance. Players act as observers or influencers in a procedurally generated universe, sculpting belief, behavior, and evolution through subtle or direct means.

No points. No victory. Just emergent stories shaped by thought and reaction.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. Clone the repo  
2. Run `start.sh` to initialize the local Flask-based simulation  
3. Choose your philosophical path via the introductory quiz  
4. Watch your civilization evolve—or intervene

## 🧬 Core Concepts

- Procedural Philosophy Engine  
- Growth defined by Resource, Knowledge, and Emotion  
- Cosmic sandbox meets cultural memory  
- Civilizational drift, ideological fusion  
- AI-assisted pixel generation and modular rendering

## 🖥️ Live Modules (to be built)

| Module             | Function                                  | Status             |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `philosophy_core`  | Stores ideological logic, traits, biases  | ⚙️ In progress     |
| `system_simulator` | Simulates solar systems and resource flow | 🧪 Prototype phase |
| `evolution_engine` | Handles mutation, adaptation, and shifts  | ⚙️ In progress     |
| `main_dashboard`   | Central UI for fleet stats and growth     | 🧠 Planning        |
| `ai_asset_forge`   | Interface for AI pixel art generation     | 🎨 Drafting        |
| `wormhole_logic`   | Governs cross-universe travel mechanics   | 🔮 Conceptual      |

## 🔮 The Codex Lives

Want full documentation? Head to `docs/` and explore each design principle in depth.

Let me know if you'd like me to start writing any of those individual files—maybe kick off `02_philosophy.md` or sketch your module architecture in `09_modules.md`. Stellara is shaping up into a philosophical operating system for sentience. Let's keep the pulse going. 🌠📁🧠
