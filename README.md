## ‚ú® Stellara: What It Is

Stellara is a living simulation of consequences. Civilizations start from core ideas and grow in a dynamic universe. You can watch them or mess with them, shaping beliefs, behaviors, and how things evolve.

No points. No winning. Just stories that happen because of ideas and reactions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

1.  Clone the repo
2.  Run `start.sh` to get the local Flask-based simulation running
3.  Choose your starting idea through the intro quiz
4.  Watch your civilization evolve‚Äîor jump in and change things

-----

## üß¨ Core Concepts

  * An engine that makes up philosophies on the fly.
  * Growth based on Resources, Knowledge, and Emotion.
  * A cosmic sandbox with a cultural memory.
  * Civilizations drift, ideas merge.
  * AI-assisted pixel art and modular rendering.

## üîÆ The Blueprint Lives

Want full documentation? Head to `docs/` and explore each design principle in depth.

Let me know if you'd like me to start writing any of those individual files‚Äîmaybe kick off `02_philosophy.md` or sketch your module architecture in `09_modules.md`. Stellara is shaping up into a philosophical operating system for sentience. Let's keep building. üå†üìÅüß†
