# üåå Stellara: Introduction

> "Not all stars burn. Some think. Some remember. Some evolve."  
> ‚Äî Stellara System Boot Sequence

## Overview

**Stellara** is a solo-developed philosophy-driven procedural simulation. It invites players to witness‚Äîand influence‚Äîthe birth and evolution of civilizations based on core ideological values. There is no winning, only *becoming*.

In Stellara, belief is the primary force. Your chosen philosophy shapes your fleet's behavior, your world's environment, and the consequences that ripple through time. It is part simulation, part anthology, and part moral experiment.

## Core Features

- üß† **Philosophical Archetypes**  
  Select from foundational ideologies like Empiricism, Honorism, Symbiotism, Entropyism, and more. Each defines how your civilization thinks, reacts, and grows.

- üöÄ **Procedural Evolution**  
  Watch fleets mutate, adapt, or fragment based on decisions, failures, and environmental pressures.

- üî≠ **Observer vs Influencer Modes**  
  Play as a passive cosmic chronicler‚Äîor as an active architect shaping your world through nudges and interference.

- üåê **Cross-Universe Interaction**  
  Unlock interdimensional travel to explore the civilizations created by other players, trade cultural elements, or observe alien philosophies in motion.

- üé® **Minimalist Design + AI-Driven Assets**  
  Pixel art ships, worlds, and phenomena generated from philosophical prompts. Clean, retro GUI overlays reflect your civilization‚Äôs current emotional and ideological state.

## Philosophical Experience

Stellara is designed as a playable thesis‚Äîa living document of consequence. It simulates:

- How philosophies evolve across time  
- How environments shape belief  
- How action and intention leave legacy  
- How civilizations remember

You are not just a player. You are a philosopher, a witness, a whisper in the dark.

## Development Notes

- Written in Python with modular architecture  
- Local HTTP server for simulation logic  
- GUI built with HTML, JS, and dynamic overlays  
- AI assets generated from prompt structures  
- Codex stored in `docs/`, modularized for expansion

## Getting Started

1. Choose your philosophy via the intro quiz  
2. Watch your world form  
3. Observe its evolution‚Äîor shape it from within  
4. Grow, drift, collapse, rise again
