# 🧠 Stellara Philosophy Framework

> “Belief is the shape of your shadow. In Stellara, it defines your stars.”

## Overview

Philosophy is the gravitational core of Stellara. It determines how civilizations behave, evolve, and interact with their environment. Each player begins by selecting or discovering a foundational ideology, which influences fleet traits, environmental reactions, and long-term growth.

## 🧬 Philosophical Traits

Each philosophy influences:

- **Fleet Design**: Ship modules, symmetry, color palettes
- **Behavior Trees**: Decision-making logic under stress
- **Environmental Response**: Attraction or aversion to anomalies
- **Evolution Priorities**: Mutation rate, upgrade paths, emotional logic

---

## 🔄 Philosophical Drift

Civilizations may shift beliefs over time due to:

- Trauma (e.g. catastrophic loss)
- Exposure to foreign ideologies
- Environmental resonance (e.g. proximity to entropy zones)
- Player influence (in Influencer Mode)

Drift can result in:

- Hybrid philosophies (e.g. “Neo-Symbiotism”)
- Schism events (splinter factions)
- Cultural renaissance or collapse

## 🧠 Emotional Logic Integration

Philosophy also affects emotional stats:

| Emotion     | Influence on Behavior                  |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Trust**   | Willingness to ally or share resources |
| **Pride**   | Resistance to change or diplomacy      |
| **Grief**   | Memory retention, lore generation      |
| **Curiosity** | Exploration and anomaly engagement   |

These stats evolve based on experience and shape future decisions.

## 🧭 Philosophy Quiz System

Players begin with a short quiz to determine their civilization’s core philosophy. Questions explore values, reactions to failure, resource priorities, and emotional tendencies.

Example:
> “How does your fleet respond to the unknown?”  
>
> - Study cautiously  
> - Embrace without hesitation  
> - Defend against threats  
> - Adapt and integrate

## 📚 Lore Hooks

Each philosophy generates unique lore entries, myths, and cultural artifacts. These are stored in the `civilization_memory` module and may influence other civilizations during cross-universe travel.
