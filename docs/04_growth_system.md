# 📈 Stellara Growth System

> “Growth is not a number. It is a memory, a belief, a consequence.”

## Overview

In Stellara, growth is a dynamic process shaped by a civilization’s philosophy, behavior, emotional state, and environmental interaction. It is not linear—it is recursive, reactive, and symbolic. Every task contributes to evolution, and every decision echoes across generations.

## 🧬 Weighted Growth Factors

Civilizations evolve based on the weighted influence of key activities:

| Factor            | Description                                      | Typical Weight Range |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| 🔧 Resources       | Fuel upgrades, repairs, and expansion            | 10–40%               |
| 📚 Knowledge       | Unlocks tech, anomaly decoding, and lore         | 15–35%               |
| ⚙️ Skills          | Improves efficiency and task execution           | 10–25%               |
| 🧠 Emotional Logic | Trust, pride, grief, curiosity—affects behavior  | 5–20%                |
| 🛰️ Exploration     | Expands map, triggers events, reveals anomalies  | 10–30%               |
| 🔥 Combat Outcomes | Sector control, defense, and survival            | 0–30%                |

Philosophy biases these weights. For example, Empiricists favor Knowledge, while Entropyists lean into Combat and Exploration.

## 🔄 Evolution Mechanics

Growth triggers evolutionary changes:

- **Trait Blooming** — New ship modules or behaviors emerge
- **Behavioral Drift** — Civilizations shift toward new philosophies
- **Environmental Response** — Universe adapts to civilization’s growth pattern
- **Emotional Mutation** — Emotional stats evolve, influencing future decisions

## 🧠 Emotional Logic System

Emotions are tracked as evolving stats:

| Emotion     | Influence on Growth                             |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Trust       | Increases diplomacy and resource sharing         |
| Pride       | Boosts defense and resistance to change          |
| Grief       | Generates lore, slows aggression                 |
| Curiosity   | Accelerates exploration and anomaly engagement   |

Emotions are shaped by events, philosophy, and player influence.

## 📊 Growth Dashboard (Planned)

Players will be able to view:

- Weighted growth factor distribution
- Trait evolution timeline
- Emotional logic graph
- Philosophy drift indicators
- Environmental reaction logs

This dashboard will help players understand not just *how* their civilization is growing—but *why*.
