# üåê Stellara Cross-Universe Interaction

> ‚ÄúWhen philosophies stabilize, they echo outward‚Äîseeking resonance among stars not their own.‚Äù

## Overview

Once a civilization reaches philosophical coherence and resource stability, it unlocks the ability to travel beyond its native universe. This feature transforms Stellara from a solo simulation into a multiversal network of evolving ideologies, cultural exchanges, and emergent drama.

---

## üöÄ Unlock Conditions

To access cross-universe travel, a civilization must:

- Reach a **stabilization threshold** (balanced growth, coherent philosophy)
- Develop **wormhole technology** or equivalent anomaly decoding
- Pass an **emotional resonance check** (e.g. trust or curiosity levels)

---

## üõ∞Ô∏è Travel Mechanics

- **Wormhole Grid**: Procedurally generated map of compatible universes
- **Signal Detection**: Players receive lore-based pings from other civilizations
- **Travel Protocols**: Fleets can visit, observe, or interact with foreign worlds

## ü§ù Interaction Modes

| Mode         | Description                                      |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Observe**  | Watch foreign civilizations evolve in real time  |
| **Influence**| Nudge beliefs, offer tech, trigger events        |
| **Trade**    | Exchange modules, emotional logic, or cultural lore |
| **Merge**    | Philosophical fusion or hybrid fleet formation   |
| **Conflict** | Optional ideological warfare or disruption       |

## üìö Universal Archive

Each visited universe contributes to a shared archive:

- **Civilization Profiles**  
  Philosophy, traits, emotional stats, growth history

- **Lore Entries**  
  Myths, journals, and cultural artifacts

- **Interaction Logs**  
  Records of influence, trade, and philosophical drift

This archive becomes a living encyclopedia of player-generated sentience.

## üîÆ Emergent Outcomes

Cross-universe travel may trigger:

- **Philosophical Mutation**  
  Exposure to foreign beliefs alters home ideology

- **Emotional Contagion**  
  Shared grief or curiosity reshapes behavior

- **Cultural Renaissance**  
  Hybrid civilizations form with new traits and lore

- **Collapse Events**  
  Incompatible ideologies destabilize fragile societies
