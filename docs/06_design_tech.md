# üñ•Ô∏è Stellara Design & Technology

> ‚ÄúMinimalism is not absence‚Äîit is clarity. Stellara speaks in symbols, not spectacle.‚Äù

## Overview

Stellara‚Äôs design philosophy embraces simplicity, modularity, and symbolic depth. The visual style is intentionally minimal, allowing players to focus on emergent behavior, philosophical drift, and emotional resonance. Technically, the system is built for solo development, scalability, and AI-assisted asset generation.

## üé® Visual Style

- **Pixel Minimalism**  
  Ships, planets, and anomalies are rendered as stylized pixel forms‚Äîblocks, glyphs, and pulses. Each asset reflects its philosophical origin.

- **Tron-Inspired GUI**  
  Glowing overlays, clean vector lines, and color-coded data panels. The interface adapts to the civilization‚Äôs emotional state.

- **Philosophy-Driven Themes**  
  GUI palettes shift based on dominant ideology:
  - Empiricism ‚Üí cool blues, data grids
  - Honorism ‚Üí golds, symmetry frames
  - Entropyism ‚Üí magentas, glitch effects

## üß† AI-Assisted Asset Generation

- **Prompt Templates**  
  Predefined prompts generate pixel art for ships, planets, and environments. Example:  
  `"Entropyist Cruiser: jagged hull, glowing fractures, chaotic symmetry"`

- **Sprite Mapping**  
  Assets are tagged with traits and behaviors, allowing dynamic rendering based on evolution.

- **Procedural Overlays**  
  Anomalies and emotional states are visualized through animated pulses, flickers, and distortions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture

- **Local HTTP Server**  
  Built with Flask or FastAPI for modular simulation logic and GUI routing.

- **Modular Repositories**  
  Each system‚Äîphilosophy, fleet, evolution, environment‚Äîis isolated for ease of testing and expansion.

- **Data Formats**  
  - JSON for philosophy traits, fleet stats, and lore  
  - CSV for growth weights and task tracking  
  - SQLite for memory logs and emotional history

## üß© GUI Components

| Component             | Function                                  |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `main_dashboard`      | Fleet overview, philosophy, emotional logic |
| `event_feed_overlay`  | Real-time consequences and lore entries   |
| `heatmap_visualizer`  | Ideological spread across sectors         |
| `influencer_controls` | Player tools for nudging civilizations    |
| `quiz_interface`      | Philosophy selection and initialization   |

## üß¨ Design Principles

- **Modularity First**  
  Every system is replaceable, extendable, and testable in isolation.

- **Symbolic Clarity**  
  Visuals are abstract but meaningful‚Äîplayers interpret, not consume.

- **Emotional Feedback**  
  GUI elements pulse, shift, and react to civilization behavior and emotional stats.
