## Stellara: Strategic Development Roadmap ðŸŒŒ

***

## Phase 1: Core Simulation MVP (Months 1-3)

This phase focuses on establishing the fundamental simulation loop and player interaction.

### Tasks

* **`philosophy_core` Development**:
  * Implement the initial 5-6 philosophical archetypes (e.g., Empiricism, Honorism, Symbiotism, Entropyism) with their core behavioral biases and influence on growth factors.
  * Define initial philosophical traits for Fleet Design, Behavior Trees, Environmental Response, and Evolution Priorities.
  * Develop the basic philosophical drift rules based on trauma, foreign ideologies, and environmental resonance.
* **`fleet_generator` & `evolution_engine` Basic Implementation**:
  * Create a basic fleet initialization system based on selected philosophy.
  * Implement core mutation and adaptation mechanics for fleets, linked to philosophical traits.
* **`event_orchestrator` (Basic)**:
  * Develop a system to trigger simple encounters (anomaly, enemy, resource).
  * Implement basic interpretation, decision, and adaptation steps within the simulation loop.
* **`growth_matrix` Implementation**:
  * Set up the weighted growth factors for Resources, Knowledge, Skills, Emotional Logic, Exploration, and Combat Outcomes.
  * Ensure philosophy biases these weights (e.g., Empiricists favor Knowledge).
* **`civilization_memory` (Basic)**:
  * Start tracking key decisions and simple emotional history.
* **`quiz_interface` & `main_dashboard` (MVP)**:
  * Develop the initial 5-10 question philosophy quiz for player initialization.
  * Create a basic main dashboard to display fleet stats, current philosophy, and evolving emotional logic.
* **`local_server_init`**:
  * Set up the Flask/FastAPI local HTTP server for simulation logic and GUI routing.

### Tests

* **Unit Tests**: For each module (`philosophy_core`, `fleet_generator`, `evolution_engine`, `growth_matrix`).
* **Integration Tests**: Verify the simulation loop (`Encounter -> Interpretation -> Decision -> Adaptation -> Drift`) functions correctly.
* **Philosophy Consistency Tests**: Ensure chosen philosophy consistently biases growth and behavior as designed.
* **GUI Functionality Tests**: Check if quiz works and dashboard displays data accurately.

### Validity Tests

* **Philosophical Coherence**: Does the chosen philosophy genuinely influence gameplay and evolution in a meaningful and observable way?
* **Simulation Loop Integrity**: Does the simulation run continuously without breaking or illogical states?
* **Player Initial Experience**: Is the philosophy quiz engaging and does it successfully determine a starting ideology?

### MVP Point

* **Playable Core Loop**: A player can start the game via the quiz, observe their chosen civilization evolve through basic encounters, and see key stats (philosophy, fleet, emotions) on a dashboard, showcasing the "Observer Mode". The simulation runs autonomously for a significant period.

## Phase 2: Engagement & Visual Polish (Months 4-7)

This phase expands player interaction and enhances the visual feedback, adding the "Influencer Mode."

### Tasks p2

* **Emotional Logic System Expansion**:
  * Refine existing emotional stats (Trust, Pride, Grief, Curiosity) and their influence.
  * Implement "Emotional Mutation" based on events and philosophy.
* **`influencer_controls` Development**:
  * Implement player tools for nudging philosophical tones, triggering environmental events (anomalies, resource shifts), injecting mutations, and influencing emotional stats.
* **`pixel_prompt_engine` & `ai_asset_forge` (Basic)**:
  * Develop initial prompt templates for generating pixel art ships, planets, and environments, linked to philosophical origin.
  * Integrate a basic interface for AI asset generation (even if a placeholder for future AI integration).
* **`event_feed_overlay` & `heatmap_visualizer`**:
  * Develop a real-time feed for consequences and lore entries.
  * Implement a basic heatmap to visualize ideological spread or resource density across sectors.
* **`system_simulator` (Basic Environmental Reactions)**:
  * Implement basic environmental reactions to civilization growth patterns (e.g., resource depletion).
* **`save_state_manager`**:
  * Implement functionality to save and load simulation states.

### Tests p2

* **Influencer Mode Responsiveness**: Verify player interventions have observable and logical effects.
* **Visual Feedback Accuracy**: Ensure GUI elements and generated assets reflect philosophical states and emotional changes.
* **Emotional System Dynamics**: Test if emotions evolve realistically and influence behavior as designed.

### Validity Tests p2

* **Meaningful Influence**: Do player actions in Influencer Mode feel impactful and provide clear feedback?
* **Aesthetic Cohesion**: Do the minimalist pixel art and Tron-inspired GUI create a cohesive and appealing visual experience?
* **Emergent Storytelling Quality**: Do the event feed and early lore entries provide a sense of evolving narrative?

### MVP Point p2

* **Interactive Simulation**: Players can now actively influence their civilization's evolution, witness compelling visual feedback reflective of philosophical and emotional states, and save their progress. This establishes both Observer and Influencer modes as distinct and engaging options.

## Phase 3: Multiversal Expansion & Polish (Months 8-12)

This phase unlocks the unique "Cross-Universe Interaction" and refines the overall experience.

### Tasks p3

* **`wormhole_logic` Development (Cross-Universe System)**:
  * Implement the stabilization threshold unlock conditions (balanced growth, coherent philosophy, emotional resonance).
  * Develop the "Wormhole Grid" for procedural generation of compatible universes.
  * Implement "Signal Detection" for pings from other civilizations.
  * Develop basic "Travel Protocols" (visit, observe).
* **`universe_archive` & `cosmic_lore_engine`**:
  * Implement storage for "Civilization Profiles" and basic "Lore Entries" from visited universes.
  * Expand procedural lore generation based on events and emotional history.
* **Advanced Emotional Engine & Philosophical Mutation**:
  * Introduce new emotional stats (fear, hope, envy, serenity).
  * Implement emotional contagion between civilizations.
  * Develop mechanics for "Philosophical Mutation" including hybrid ideologies and schism events.
* **Performance Optimization**:
  * Review and optimize code for large-scale simulations and GUI responsiveness.
* **Final GUI Polish & Theming**:
  * Ensure GUI palettes shift dynamically based on dominant ideology.
  * Refine all dashboard and overlay elements for intuitive understanding.
* **Documentation & Onboarding**:
  * Finalize comprehensive documentation for players and potential modders.
  * Refine the introductory experience and hints.

### Tests p3

* **Cross-Universe Functionality**: Test seamless travel, observation, and archive logging.
* **Stability Threshold Validation**: Ensure civilizations only unlock cross-universe travel when all conditions are met.
* **New Emotion Integration**: Verify new emotions correctly influence behavior and growth.
* **Performance Benchmarking**: Ensure the simulation remains fluid with increased complexity.

### Validity Tests p3

* **Multiversal Immersion**: Does the cross-universe feature genuinely enhance the sense of a shared, evolving cosmos?
* **Philosophical Depth**: Do the expanded emotional and philosophical mutation systems create more complex and believable civilization trajectories?
* **User Experience**: Is the game intuitive, stable, and rewarding for the target audience?

### MVP Point p3

* **Multiversal Discovery & Interaction**: The game includes a robust single-player experience with both Observer and Influencer modes, and players can now access and explore other player-generated (or pre-generated placeholder) universes, view their profiles, and begin to grasp the concept of inter-civilization dynamics. This represents the fulfillment of the core "Cross-Universe Interaction" promise.

## Post-Launch: Continuous Development & Expansion

Following the MVP release, focus will shift to ongoing content, community features, and exploring the "Long-Term Vision."

* **Multiplayer Overlay (Asynchronous)**: Implement lore trading, emotional logic exchange, and optional ideological conflict/fusion.
* **Cosmological Events**: Introduce universe-wide tests of resilience and belief.
* **Modularity & Plugin System**: Fully support and promote community-built philosophies and fleets.
* **"Legacy Mode"**: For archiving and replaying civilization journeys.
* **Educational Modules & Real-world Data Integration**: Explore academic partnerships and deeper philosophical modeling.

This phased roadmap provides a clear path for Stellara's development, ensuring critical features are built and tested iteratively, leading to a strong, unique product.
